                    <p class="text">As the title says this is a very simple sous vide steak recepie. Sous Vide is a method of cooking vacuum sealed food,
                        specially meats and fish, in a warm water bath for long period of time anywhere from 1 to 36hrs depending
                        of the food being cooked. This method makes cooking a tender steak to the desired temperature much easier 
                        and consistant. Its main downsisde is the amount of time it takes to cook the steak and the extra equipment
                        requirement. You will need a sous vide capable machine, there are many out there and prices can range from 
                        as low as $59.99 to $500+. I recomend the 
                        <a href="https://anovaculinary.com/anova-precision-cooker/?adnet=g&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7sXw-N2t9QIV8iCtBh16RAuAEAAYASADEgKXcvD_BwE">Anova precision </a>
                        or the

                        if you are looking an air-fryer combo. Last but not least to cook the perfect sous vide steak you will also need a grill, cast iron skillet, air-fryer or oven.

                                for even cooking. If using zip-lock submerge steak in water wtiht the zip-lock open and allow the water to pushe the air out
                                then seal the zip-lock. If unable to completely submerge turn steak half way through the cooking process.</p>

                                will become mushy. For best results cook 1 to 2hrs. The thickness of the cut will determine where in the range 
                                you fall with the rule of thumb being: the thicker the cut the longer the time.</p>
