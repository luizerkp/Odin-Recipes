                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                In separate bowls season the beef, goat/lamb, pork and chicken with the juice of 1-lime, 1/4-tsp of salt, and 1/4-tsp of black 
                                pepper. Mariate for at least 30mins but 1hr-1.5hrs will produce best results.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                While th meat marinates peel and cube the cassava, yam, malanga, and pumpkin/squash. Peel and slice plantains in ~1/8th inch slices 
                                but save half a plantain for later. Grate the left over plantain into a bowl for later. Cut mushroom and carrots into medium sized 
                                pieces. Chop cilantro and onion. Cut corn into 1/2 inch slices.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After meat finishes marinating, in large pot heat oil on medium-high heat. Add cilantro, garlic, onion, oregano, remaining salt,
                                and remaining pepper. Cook until fragrant (~2mins). Next you will want to add the meats in sequence:
                                <br>
                                <b class="notes">Note: reduce heat to medium after adding the first meat</b>
                                <ul class="ul-list">
                                    <li>1st add beef, cook for 10mins</li>
                                    <li>2nd add goat/lamb, cook for 10mins</li>
                                    <li>3rd add pork and pork ribs, cook for 10mins</li>
                                    <li>4th add chicken, cook for 5mins</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add the cassava, yam, malanga, pumpkin/squash and sliced plantain. Add enough water or stock to cover the top of the 
                                vegetables and bring heat to medium-high. Add bouillon and the juice of the remaining lime. After water/stock starts boiling 
                                lower heat to low and bring to a simmer. Add smoked bones, sussage, grated plantain and mushroom. Let it simmer until everything 
                                is completely cooked adding water/stock as neccesaary. Add corn and carrots, cook for ~10mins or until corn is completely cooked. Taste broth 
                                and add salt if needed. The broth should have thickenned by now but if not thick enough cook with open lid until broth thinkens.
